# MLops

This project about understanding of MLops concepts. We have created predicition(restuarant revenue) model using Linear regression. 
We have run ML experiment and track the model with Weight & Biases(WandB). We have run more than 5 model with different hyperparameters and scaling techniques.
We have deploy model using endpoint using FASTAPI. Created a small APP (UI) which allows users to input data for all the features and get predictions from FAST API end point.
Lastely checked the model drift using alibi-detect library
